# Image-analysis

This repository contains a collection of image analysis projects covering a wide range of topics including image recognition, model learning, image registration, 3D reconstruction, and structure from motion in 2D.

## Repository Structure

Each project is organized into its own folder. Typically, within each folder, the following files can be found:

- `main.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating the core implementation and results for the project.
- `functions.py`: Contains key supporting functions used in the notebook.
- `supplied.py`: Includes additional utility functions provided or pre-written for use in the project.
- `report.pdf` (if available): A detailed report discussing the methodology, results, and conclusions (available in the final folder).

## Projects

1. **Image Recognition**  
   Techniques and implementations for identifying and classifying image content.

2. **Model Learning**  
   Application of machine learning models to learn patterns from images.

3. **Image Registration**  
   Aligning images into a common coordinate system using transformation techniques.

4. **3D Reconstruction**  
   Recovering 3D structure from 2D images using computer vision methods.

5. **Structure from Motion (2D)**  
   Reconstructing the camera motion and scene structure from a sequence of 2D images.
